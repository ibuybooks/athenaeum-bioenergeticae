Thyroid is the basic regulator of blood glucose, and it causes it to be fully oxidized for energy, so that it produces ATP efficiently, on relatively few calories. If blood glucose falls, because it's being used very quickly, the body responds with stress hormones, including glucagon, adrenalin, and cortisol. They cause fat and protein to be burned for energy, while in hypothyroidism, glucose can still be used inefficiently for glycolysis, producing lactic acid, displacing bicarbonate and carbon dioxide. This causes mineral imbalances, with effects including cramps and nerve-muscle tension, which produce heat and waste energy. When you first start taking thyroid again, your tissues will need some extra magnesium, during the time when the dose is increasing, and when the mineral balance is restored your temperature and metabolic rate might decrease a little. Orange juice, milk, and coffee are good for the main minerals, while salting your food to taste."

          "answer": "If low cholesterol is combined with slightly low thyroid, the protective steroids aren't produced in normal amounts, and inflammatory processes develop. Connective tissue pain, waist fat, and constipation relate to the stress-inflammation processes, for example endotoxin slows the liver's detoxifying process, estrogen and serotonin signal defensive reactions that lead to cumulative problems. Sweet fruits are anti-inflammatory and help to keep the liver functioning, including keeping cholesterol up and keeping estrogen and cortisol under control. When estrogen is relatively high, tryptophan turns into serotonin and slows the thyroid, lowers the temperature. Glycine is the main anti-inflammatory amino acid, and it can normally be made in adequate amounts, but some proteins, especially muscle meats, don't have enough Glycine in relation to tryptophan. Fruits and milk or cheese will usually provide a good balance of the main nutrients, but sometimes gelatin is very useful to balance the other proteins. The calcium content of milk and cheese is important for lowering inflammation, and helps to prevent excess fat deposition. Sodium and vitamin K are closely involved in calcium metabolism."

Having more very bright light (several hundred watts of incandescent bulbs) in the hours from sundown until bedtime will lower them a little more. Since T<sub>3</sub> is used up very quickly, allowing the proinflammatory TSH to rise during the night, it would help if you used Cynoplus at bedtime, instead of Cynomel. If you were taking 10 mcg of cynomel, then a third of a tablet of cynoplus would provide that, as well as the T<sub>4</sub> that holds the TSH down longer. Having an egg every day, and liver once a week, will help to balance the effects of the thyroid hormone, which increases your need for vitamins, especially vitamin A."

The food proteins (along with tissue proteins) can be used for energy under the influence of cortisol. Meats, other than beef, lamb, venison, and bison, usually contain enough polyunsaturated fat to affect estrogen, testosterone, and energy production. Stress, or increased cortisol, increases the circulating cysteine and tryptophan from muscle (meats), and these together with cortisol tend to increase aromatase. The high ratio of phosphate to calcium in meat activates a variety of stress processes; a high intake of calcium supports energy metabolism. Sugars tend to lower circulating free fatty acids, amino acids, and cortisol, while activating the thyroid hormone."

Sugar craving is usually caused by the need for sugar, generally caused by hypothyroidism.When yeasts have enough sugar, they just happily make ethanol, but when they don't have sugar, they can sink filaments into the intestine wall seeking it, and, if the person is very weak, they can even invade the bloodstream and other organs. Milk, cheese, and fruits provide a very good balance of nutrients. Fruits provide a significant amount of protein. Plain sugar is o.k. when the other nutrients are adequate. Roots, shoots, and tubers are, next to the fruits, a good carbohydrate source; potatoes are a source of good protein. Meat as the main protein can provide too much phosphorus in relation to calcium."

How does this relate to hypoglycemia in the context of trying to “keep it at a good level” by frequent food intake. Does this mean keeping it high in regards to what ones normal fasting level is (perhaps 90 or above), or high in regards to being above 70 (indicating hunger)? If one never feels hungry could this be because blood sugar is always 15 to 20 points above 70? What is happening when the cold nose of adrenalin surge occurs with a blood sugar level of 90 or above?",
          "answer": "A really healthy person can go all day on stored glycogen, but most people deplete the glycogen quickly, then produce cortisol to convert tissue protein to glucose, and while doing that, shift to using more fat. The fat blocks the use of glucose, so it can raise blood glucose. In the 1940s and '50s the average american had a different metabolism. With fatty acids interfering with glucose oxidation, creating “insulin resistance,” adrenaline is secreted even when the blood glucose level seems good."

If the fat is mostly saturated, from milk, cheese, butter, beef, lamb or coconut oil, I think it's usually o.k. to get about 50% of the calories from fat, but since those natural fats typically contain around 2% polyunsaturated fats, I try to minimize my PUFA intake by having more fruit, and a little less fat, maybe 30 to 35%."

          "answer": "Although we can make our own fats from sugars, I think it's good to have some fat in our food, because of its effects on the intestine especially. Experiments on an isolated loop of intestine, measuring the nutrients entering the bloodstream, showed that relatively simplified mixtures of nutrients were poorly digested. Fat, protein, sugars, and minerals, in combination, activated the intestine, increasing the digestion of all of them, when they were present at the same time. If the fats are mostly saturated, as in butter, coconut oil, or beef or lamb fat, roughly a third of the calories is good, but the ideal proportion probably depends on the specific foods and the person's level of activity. Increasing either fat or sugar can have some specific therapeutic effects, but when more information becomes available about the composition of particular fruits, I suspect that the ideal balance of nutrients will lean toward the sugars, supported by ketoacids and short-chain saturated fats. The polyunsaturated fatty acids, which break down into toxic fragments and free radicals and prostaglandin-like chemicals, are&ndash;along with bacterial toxins produced in the intestine&ndash;the source of the main inflammatory and degenerative problems. Sugar and the minerals in fruits are fairly effective in keeping free fatty acids from being released from our tissues, and the fats we synthesize from them are saturated, and aren't likely to be stored as excess fat, because they don't suppress metabolism (as polyunsaturated fats and some amino acids do). The minerals of fruits and milk contribute to metabolic activation, and prevention of free-radical damage."

With bone broth, it's the cartilage, ligaments and tendons that are helpful; marrow has a lot of iron, and it's good to limit the amount of iron and phosphate. Well cooked greens have a high ratio of calcium and magnesium to phosphate, and these help to activate oxidative metabolism. Endotoxin from bacterial overgrowth is important in both diabetes and fatty liver. Aspirin helps to lower inflammation and blood glucose, while promoting oxidative metabolism. Coffee has some similar effects. Some people have told me that using fructose eliminated the fat from their liver; I think its reduction of phosphate might be involved in its protective effects, while supporting oxidative metabolism."

Barbara McClintock's work with corn showed that a change in the plants' environment causes them to shift their genes around, sort of equivalent to internal hybridization. When something new is added to the genome, it changes the results of the rearrangement, unpredictably. Since seeds always contain toxins, anyway, a new allergen probably isn't too important, and the traditional alkali processing of corn might take care of it."

Real animal rennet is still safe, as far as I know. Industrial grade citric acid is a serious allergen for some people, because it contains contaminants that aren't in natural fruit citric acid, but it's probably safer than the industrial “enzymes.” The producers of the enzyme products claim they are highly purified, but some people react as though they still contain some antigens from the microorganisms. The traditional cheeses were made with milk that soured with the bacteria that lived in the cows, but now it's common to sterilize the milk, and then add cultures, or enzymes, or citric acid, for standardization&mdash;but they often put their faith in a commercial product that seems to work well, but that could have serious allergenic contaminants. The same thing has been happening with aged cheeses, many places are no longer letting the native molds infect the cheese curds. Homogenizing doesn't cause any problems&mdash;unless they use solvents/detergents for adding the vitamins A and D that are required in milk with reduced fat. The vitamins aren't normally added to whole milk or cream."

The enzyme that thickens the milk sometimes works with very little acid formed. How sour the kefir is suggests how much lactic acid is in it. There are types of yogurt that have much of the acidic whey drained out, that aren't a problem. A spoonful or two of acidic yogurt isn't harmful, but a cupful of the acidic type can be enough to deplete the liver's energy stores, because lactic acid is converted to glucose in the liver, requiring energy. The “strained” type that isn't acidic is similar to cottage cheese and is safe."

I doubt that this is a matter of genetic differences; for example this person: “I was recently diagnosed with lactose intolerance and so i had to eliminated milk and milk products from my diet. I live in the USA. However, on a recent trip to India, I had milk and all possible milk products there and it did not affect me at all! Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have a possible explanation?” When a woman or a cow eats an allergen, such as peanuts or soybeans, the allergens appear in the milk. Weeds in the pasture are another potential source of tainted milk. In Africa and India, milk production per cow is much lower than in the US, because they seldom give them anything but grass, or in India, hay, probably some fruit. Although insecticides such as lindane are no longer used in US dairies, most of the milk in commerce has synthetic vitamins (dissolved in corn oil) emulsified into the product, which could account for many of the bad reactions."

Cottage cheese, that is, milk curds with salt, is very good, if you can find it without additives, but traditional cottage cheese was almost fat-free, so when they make it with whole milk you should watch for other innovations that might not be beneficial."

Given the PUFA issues you've mentioned with eggs, if a person is unable to include milk in their diet and is minimizing their egg intake, will they get enough vitamin A & D from beef liver?",

The charts have stopped giving its vitamin E content, and rarely mention vitamin K, but it's very good for those. Charts still don't reflect the intracellular (lipid soluble dehydro-) form of vitamin C, but liver is a good source of that too."

The rationale is that it becomes tender, as the enzymes cause the meat to digest itself. That process starts after the glucose and glycogen in the muscle have been depleted, and the collagen and other proteins begin to be degraded. Besides losing the amino acid balance of fresh meat, the products include the cancer-promoting polyamines. Liver contains far more of the self-digesting enzymes than muscles do, and its glycogen is depleted in just a few hours. This is why liver in the US tastes so terrible. Since liver and eggs contain many of the same essential nutrients in high concentration, and eggs don't digest themselves, that's why I eat a few eggs in the US, despite their known high content of PUFA. When I can avoid the PUFA, I do; and in Mexico, liver and other meats aren't stored, except maybe in the supermarkets that serve foreigners."

A small amount of coconut oil with each meal will increase the ability to oxidize fat, by momentarily stopping the antithyroid effect of the PUFA. Aspirin is another thing that reduces the stress-related increase of free fatty acids, stimulating metabolism. Taking a thyroid supplement is reasonable until the ratio of saturated fats to PUFA is about 2 to 1."

          "answer": "Until a few years ago, I would drink a couple of quarts of orange juice from pulp-free frozen concentrate every day, then I started noticing those allergy symptoms, and investigated their production processes. They had recently introduced an enzyme technology to make pulp more water soluble. For years, it had been used to dispose of massive amounts of otherwise waste pulp by putting it into the “creamy” or “home style” pulpy juices, but then suddenly the relatively clear so-called pulp-free juice began leaving a residue on glasses, and resisting passage through filter paper, besides causing allergy symptoms. For several decades I have watched as traditionally safe foods have been altered, and have found that many people have developed allergic problems when their favorite foods were changed by new technologies. Since intestinal bacteria affect the allergenicity of foods that are poorly digested, changing the flora can often relieve the symptoms. Raw carrot contains some antibiotics that can be helpful; oil and vinegar can increase the germicidal effects. It's important to use oil and vinegar that aren't allergenic themselves. Hypothyroidism increases the susceptibility to many foods."

About a year later I discovered by reading food labels that these reactions were always preceded by consumption of high fructose corn syrup. E.g., if I drank Pepsi with regular sugar, nothing bad happened. If I drank Pepsi with HFCS, the symptoms appeared within minutes, and were very intense to a degree that left me unable to concentrate in my studies for about two hours. The Oreo cookies that preceded my first reaction contained HFCS.",

Seafood, especially oysters, shrimp, squid, etc., would provide the iodine and selenium you need for good thyroid regulation. Increasing fruits in place of bread would increase blood sugar stability, and would provide vitamin C in a safer form. Taking your temperature before and after breakfast helps to interpret your circadian hormone cycle&mdash;hypothyroid people often have very high adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones during the night, causing the temperature to be higher before breakfast than after. A daily raw carrot often helps to balance progesterone, cortisol, and estrogen, by improving intestine-liver functions."

Preceding the protein with some carbohydrate makes the protein go farther, otherwise under the influence of cortisol a lot of protein is used just for energy. Your diet might below in vitamin A, so it would be better to have eggs for breakfast, preceded with a generous amount of orange juice. Bananas can be seriously allergenic, apples are allergenic for some people, but not as intensely as bananas. Well cooked potatoes, with butter or cream,are a very good way to get carbohydrate, if you aren't allergic to them, because they contain a good balance of amino acids, too, as well as minerals and B vitamins."

The average person is likely to be hypothyroid, and to need only 5,000 units per day. Avoiding large amounts of carotene, and getting plenty of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> to be able to convert any carotene that's in your food, helps to use vitamin A efficiently."

          "answer": "Yes, vitamin A and estrogen are antagonistic, and while estrogen promotes keratinization (shedding of skin cells), vitamin A opposes it. Since vitamin A is highly unsaturated, in excess it suppresses the thyroid, so it has to be balanced with the thyroid; the combination is effective for increasing progesterone and decreasing estrogen, slowing the turnover of skin cells, and making the skin cells function longer before flaking off. Plugged pores, combined with a local shift toward synthesizing inflammatory substances, foster bacterial infection. Bright light stimulates the production of steroids, and consumes vitamin A very quickly, but when the balance is right, the acne clears up in just a day or two. Cream, butter, eggs, and liver are good sources of vitamin A. When people supplement thyroid and eat liver once or twice a week, their acne and dandruff (and many other problems) usually clear up very quickly. It was acne and dandruff that led me into studying the steroids and thyroid, and in the process I found that they were related to constipation and food sensitivity."

The toxic effects of extremely big doses, such as 500,000 to a million i.u., seem to be from either oxidative processes (rancidity) that are prevented by adequate vitamin E, or by antithyroid effects. I found that when my need for vitamin A began to decrease I tended to accumulate carotene in my calluses; that happens when the thyroid function is lower, reducing the need for vitamin A. Since you are eating foods with carotene, the calluses on your palms or soles should serve as an indicator of when your tissues are saturated with vitamin A. About 100 i.u. of vitamin E would help to keep the vitamin A from being wasted by oxidation, and possibly could reduce your requirement for it."

Because of manufacturing impurities, any supplement can be irritating to the digestive system, but usually taking it with food is o.k. When an oral supplement causes problems, the oily vitamins can be used on the skin, but the amount absorbed is usually much less. I think a blood level of 50 to 55 ng/ml is optimal.

          "answer": "My thesis adviser, Arnold Soderwall, did some studies showing that vitamin E extended fertility considerably. I found some of his old Sigma (chemical company) vitamin E still in the freezer, and I was working on the idea that oxidative catalysts in the liver were directly related to estrogen's effects. I would extract lipids from the liver, and use paper chromatography to separate them, and for reference points I used the vitamin E and different quinones (coenzyme Q10, Q6, and benzoquinone). I happened to mix the vitamin E with one of the quinones, and noticed that it turned almost black; all of the quinones had the same effect. Putting the mixture on the paper, the moving solvent separated the original components. Delocalized electrons absorb low energy light, causing a dark color (as in black semiconductors), and Szent-Gyorgyi had expressed wonder about what could cause the dark color of the healthy liver, a color that can't be extracted as a pigment. This experiment convinced me that vitamin E could be one of the participants in delocalizing electrons for activating proteins in the way S-G suggested. However, the technology for manufacturing vitamin E has changed greatly over the years, and I have never found anything sold as vitamin E that produces the same dark colors as that old stuff from the freezer. I don't know whether the powerfully therapeutic (anti-estrogenic, clot-clearing, anti-inflammatory, quinone-reactive) old vitamin E contained “impurities” that were effective, or whether it's that the newer materials contain impurities that reduce their effects."

But non-GMO soy is mostly produced using other herbicides and pesticides, and each pesticide has different affinities for oil or water, so oil soluble pesticides would be the main concern, and those are generally much more volatile than vitamin E, and so if they were present in the crude oil, they would end up mostly in the refined oil, rather than in the vitamin E. The thickest, darkest, vitamin E is likely to be the cleanest."

I have known people whose thyroid function improved noticeably when they increased their protein from 20 grams to 40 grams daily. (A quart of milk has 32 grams of protein, an egg about 6 grams.) If you depend on chicken for your major protein, it will contribute to suppressing your thyroid and progesterone. Increased salt helps to increase your metabolic rate. Low thyroid makes you lose salt too easily, and temporarily just eating more salt helps to make up for low thyroid-adrenals-progesterone."

Ferritin binds iron, and while it's bound it is less likely to produce random free radical damage.

If I had put vitamin A anywhere on my face or arms, enough would touch my lips to cause the headache. It wasn't the vitamin A or magnesium itself that did it, but some very powerful allergen in the chemically manufactured products. It's possible that some such substance has entered the T<sub>3</sub> during its manufacture, so using a different brand might avoid the effect.

Most vitamin E products contain small amounts of potentially harmful impurities. The amount of aspartate in a tablet of magnesium aspartate is harmless, but it's good to be cautious; I knew someone who began having daily seizures when he used large amounts of magnesium and calcium aspartate; his daily seizures continued for four months, and stopped the day after he discontinuted the supplements. I think there's a risk of methyl imbalance when large amounts of betaine are used chronically."

Milk drinkers tend to be the least obese (e.g., the Masai people). One study saw an association of skimmed milk with prostate cancer, but not whole milk, probably because fat people avoid whole milk. Powdered eggshells are a good alternative source of calcium, but milk and cheese are better. When the TSH is lower, the estrogen will probably be lower too."

Increasing your intake of all the main minerals, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium usually helps in the short term, but the balance isn't stable if your thyroid is low. Milk, orange juice, coffee (even decaffeinated coffee is a good source of magnesium), and well salted foods, support thyroid functions.

The alarm reaction that happens at night has its effects in every organ; for the brain, it's similar to epilepsy; for the intestine and bladder, the effect can be either adrenergic or cholinergic, ie, too little or too much muscle tone; the blood becomes more concentrated. The bowel reaction causes absorption of endotoxin, which is a broad-spectrum poison; carrot salad, laxatives, etc., are especially important during the adjustment time. Cholesterol has a long history as a protectant against many toxins; I think this relates to the fact that people with very low cholesterol have such a high incidence of endotoxin-related symptoms. It might also relate to the therapeutic effects of eggnogs, though it takes a lot of eggs to raise the cholesterol a little."

          "answer": "Both T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> can lower TSH, helping to shrink a goiter, but doing it with just T<sub>3</sub> would tend to give you a fast pulse and a tendency to over-heat. Cynoplus has a generally good balance of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, a 4 to 1 ratio; some people use a little T<sub>3</sub> with it, according to how they feel and function. It's available from farmaciadelnino.mx{farmaciadelnino.mx}. One of the effect of T<sub>3</sub> is to lower your estrogen (aspirin helps too) while increasing your progesterone. Estrogen tends to enlarge a goiter, by blocking the enzyme that converts thyroglobulin (“colloid”) to the active secreted hormones, and progesterone activates those enzymes. If the goiter is visibly enlarged, a certain amount of progesterone can activate the conversion of thyroglobulin to the extent of producing hyperthyroidism during the process (e.g., with a resting pule rate of about 125 beats per minute). It's better to do it slowly with thyroid supplements suppressing TSH. Pregnenolone, being converted to progesterone, might have similar accelerating effects."

When TSH is normalized, the antibodies tend to subside over a period of several months. The low vitamin D contributes to an inflammatory state; keeping calcium intake high relative to phosphate supports vitamin D and thyroid functions."

So taking that amount makes up for what your gland would be producing; by suppressing TSH, which stimulates the growth and activity of the thyroid, it also protects against the recurrence of cancer if it wasn't all removed (some types of cancer were treated just by supplementing thyroid, without surgery). Since the desiccated thyroid is made available by being digested, it's best to divide the day's dose, with some at each meal and at bedtime, so that the amount of active hormone entering the blood isn't too high at any time."

T<sub>4</sub> builds up slowly in the tissues, over about 14 days, but the T<sub>3</sub> acts immediately. With any product, a single dose of T<sub>3</sub> of about 4 mcg is close to the physiological range; sometimes a smaller amount is enough."

A healthy person should produce the equivalent of about four grains per day, so with 2 grains of supplement, or the equivalent, there isn't a risk of over-dosing."

Usually 4 or 5 mcg at a time is o.k. (the body makes about 4 mcg per hour). I don't think there's likely to be any problem using desiccated thyroid if the product is good, but because of changing manufacturing methods, that's largely a matter of trial and error. Low ferritin is often a result of hypothyroidism. The need for thyroid increases greatly during the winter in high latitudes, for example when I needed half a grain in the summer, I had to increase it to two grains during the winter. When cholesterol is high, that can make it easier to adapt to a thyroid supplement, since the thyroid will stimulate the conversion of cholesterol into progesterone and the adrenal hormones."

Cytomel's formulation has changed recently, so I'm not sure of its present potency. In areas with fluoridated water, taking a tablet with water can inactivate it. With good Cytomel, once a person has taken a very big dose, the liver produces enzymes to inactivate it quickly, so after 12 hours the blood level will become too low, and another big dose will be needed. Stress hormones are responsible for raising reverse T<sub>3</sub>, and just supplementing T<sub>3</sub> is seldom enough to normalize the stress hormones, so continued use of large doses can maintain improved functioning, but at the risk of developing problems from the continued excess of those hormones."

By powdering the Cynomel, and dividing each tablet into about 20 pieces, each dose will be just enough to be able to sense an effect, starting within seconds, and then fading away in the next few hours. By checking your pulse rate, you'll be able to correlate the dose with changes in the fatigue and waakness. If you space the doses by 3 or more hours, after several days you should be able to see some slight but consistent changes in your pulse rate, and when you do, whether it's slower or faster, wait for it to be steady at that rate for a few days before deciding to increase the dose.

          "answer": "Since progesterone helps the thyroid to secrete, and helps the liver to regulate glucose and convert T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>, women who are low in progesterone usually have hypothyroid symptoms (because of insufficient T<sub>3</sub>), including high cortisol, which promotes the synthesis of estrogen (in several ways, but never from progesterone). Cortisol is made from progesterone, but increasing the supply of progesterone reliably lowers cortisol synthesis, acting on the brain, pituitary, and adrenal glands. Progesterone, by many mechanisms, including its antagonism to cortisol, lowers the amount of estrogen in cells (causing the estrogen-binding proteins to be degraded, inhibiting the enzymes that release estrogen from the sulfates and glucuronides, and activating the enzymes that detoxify estrogen). So I think the symptoms of increased estrogen and cortisol are the result of either extraneous ingredients in the creams, or from using it at the wrong time, for example, too early, triggering premature ovulation. Supplementing a small amount of T<sub>3</sub>, Cytomel or Cynomel, usually stops symptoms such as breast pain, irritability, and restless energy, in less than an hour."

          "answer": "A friend, whose doctor gave her progesterone during her second pregnancy, said the baby “just popped out.” Katharina Dalton wrote about her experience using progesterone during pregnancy. When it's used along with good nutrition and good thyroid function, I think it prevents childbirth pain. I've heard it described as a “chemical midwife.” Labor consumes a lot of glucose, and is likely to deplete glycogen stores if it's prolonged, so I suspect that the main effect of dates is to prevent hypoglycemia. They contain some serotonin, which can increase uterine contraction. Hypoglycemia increases adrenaline, and adrenaline can cause uterine inertia, increasing the risk of hemorrhage, so I think any good source of sugar, such as fruit juice, is protective during labor."

If a woman is using a large amount, I think it's best to imitate a natural menstrual cycle, because after several days, the liver begins to excrete it, and it takes a few days for the liver enzymes to return to the previous level. When it's taken every day, the effect of a dose doesn't last as long, making it less economical.

          "answer": "Regarding the pregnenolone steal theory, It would be interesting to know who started that, it's a mechanical way of thinking about physiology that ignores the things that really matter. Thyroid hormone, vitamin A, and cholesterol support the formation of pregnenolone, and the well nourished body is able to make large adjustments in these, to minimize the need for cortisol. In health, enough pregnenolone and progesterone are produced to inhibit the stress systems, for example by inhibiting the release of ACTH. When something prevents the formation of pregnenolone and progesterone, rising ACTH will increase its production as conditions permit, but if something, such as thyroid hormone, is lacking, the ACTH will increase cortisol, often with DHEA and the androgens increasing too, if resources permit; sometimes the stressed system is able to sustain only cortisol and aldosterone production, and that leads to degenerative problems."

And a single dose is often all it takes, and continued, or bigger, doses don't do anything more."

It would probably be more expensive than getting it from the places that produce it as the end product. They might still be using the same technology from the crude saponin to pregnenolone. New, more efficient technologies that are more profitable sometimes produce radically different products, for example ascorbic acid after 1955 and vitamin E after the 1990s."

The protein is needed to detoxify estrogen, unsaturated oils, etc, and to maintain the T<sub>3</sub>. Protein deficiency gives antithyroid signals, and T<sub>4</sub> will be used to make reverse T<sub>3</sub> to inhibit T<sub>3</sub>'s effects.

Having the carrots raw (shredded, with a little olive oil, vinegar, and salt) would help with the hormone balance, and protect the intestine against inflammation. Supplementing pregnenolone wouldn't have the risk of the DHEA being converted to estrogen, which tends to happen when thyroid function is low. A small supplement of Armour thyroid or the equivalent could quickly lower the cholesterol, and since cholesterol is converted by thyroid into pregnenolone and DHEA, that would probably help the testosterone. Some shellfish (oysters, shrimp, squid, etc.) or low fat fish would provide trace minerals that might be lacking in your diet. Several eggs per week, or liver once a week, can help with other nutrients that are probably deficient in your present foods. Well cooked potatoes, with butter or cream, fruit, and well cooked greens are other foods have vitamins and minerals that are helpful."

Desjardin is a good representative of the people studying estrogen's effects on neurotransmitters, but my article(s) on Alzheimer's disease (the editor of Townsend Letter for Doctors said they were planning to print it, but I don't get the magazine so I don't know whether they did) has a lot of references. My newsletter on the physiology of hot flushes coming out in a couple of months and this month's epilepsy article will have some others. Estrogen activates the excitotoxic pathway in a great variety of ways, promoting acetylcholine and excitatory amino acids, but it also has an extremely general association with histamine. It also acts on the prostaglandin and free fatty acid signalling systems, adenosine, endorphin, endozepine, all of the amine transmitters, and interacts with everything else of nervous importance, such as the “anandamides.” Estrogen's effects on calcium, potassium, nitric oxide, lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide relate to both the question of autoimmunity and nerve actions.\n\n People have been mentioning a variety of problems associated with myalgia, such as pulmonary hypertension and diabetes. In past newsletters I have already talked about the meaning of hypothyroidism/high estrogen/free fatty acids in many diseases, but I will soon be trying to put all of the degenerative diseases into context by focussing on the role of cardiolipin in mitochondrial function, and how that relates to diet and hormones. The loss of copper and overloading with iron, seen in inflammatory states and hyperestrogenism/hypothyroidism, is one of the factors that tend to make the respiratory defect get worse."

Signs that are commonly said to be from estrogen deficiency are often from estrogen excess."

Animal experimenters can make animals that lack the adrenal medulla by scooping out everything inside the adrenal capsule, and the remaining cells quickly regenerate the steroid producing tissues, the cortex.

I think the absence of higher prolactin means that something is protecting systemically against estrogen, which activates prolactin via serotonin and cortisol. Cortisol increases the formation of serotonin a direct stimulus to prolactin, and the androgens and progesterone oppose cortisol's effects."

When there are actual forces being applied to our intestine from the inside, created by bacterial growth, gas, and toxins, our consciousness tries to make sense of it, and the result can be dizziness, a sense of disorientation or falling, so that our sense of location can seem ambiguous or confused."

Another person noticed an overlap of thyroglobulin with joint tissue. Maybe the milk increased the growth of that kind of bacteria. I think the already increased circulation in your thyroid means that progesterone won't increase its activity. Have you used a little olive oil on your skin to make it easier to spread? Covering your whole leg would increase the effect on your ankle. Is there enough sugar in your diet? Have you tried breathing in a bag occasionally, to increase your CO<sub>2</sub>?"

Thyroid's important functions for the skin are the production of steroids and preventing their imbalance, and maintaining the immune function and production of sebum. Other nutritional deficiencies, especially the balance between vitamin E and unsaturated fats, affect the functions of vitamin A and thyroid, so it's important to include foods like liver, eggs, oysters, fruits, and milk in the diet.

Both vitamin A and zinc are essential in the right amount for good skin health, but too much of either can disturb the immune function. Irritation of the intestine is often involved in skin problems, and supplements always contain trace contaminants that can cause reactions. When ADM bought Distillation Products from Eastman several years ago, the composition of their vitatmin E products went through several changes, and competing companies began making similar changes. Since then research results haven't been as consistent as they were 40 to 60 years ago, and I stopped recommending amounts up to a few hundred units per day, waiting to see more results of research. Some of the products sold as vitamin E now contain significant amounts of PUFA, and lack some of the substances such as octacosanol that were in traditional products. The right amount of thyroid is essential for skin immunity and metabolism of steroids in the skin. Topical anti inflammatory things such as tetracycline and aspirin often produce the quickest response."

          "answer": "Starting with the nosebleeds, thyroid has probably been the basic problem, so checking your temperature and resting pulse rate (at least twice a day, at waking, and about an hour after breakfast) would be a place to start. Having someone check your Achilles tendon reflex relaxation rate is helpful; the relaxation should be instantaneous, so that your foot falls floppily. A daily carrot might take care of the itch, if not, 10% sulfur soap, or dusting with flowers of sulfur, USP, should do it. Milk with sugar or honey (about an ounce in a glass) at bedtime would help to get to sleep, and reduce the night stress. Blood sugar falls at night, too low if your thyroid is deficient, and is compensated by the stress hormones. Your lowest temperature should be at night, but the stress hormones can cause your waking temperature to be higher than the midday temperature. Pulse rate should follow the same pattern, rising with breakfast, and staying above 80/minute during the day. Aspirin can help with increasing your metabolic rate. Mary Shomon's thyroid website and have good information about thyroid. I use Cynoplus and Cynomel from , which are generally more economical and more consistent than some of the glandular products."

          "answer": "I've always been very cautious about moles, since I think they have the potential to degenerate into metastatic cancer. Around 1978, I had been watching one on my belly, that had enlarged from an original nearly flat soft light brown mole, to a large, irregular, leathery black thing. A couple of doctors had urged me to have it removed. I happened to be experimenting with steroids, including DHEA, at the time. One night as I went to bed, I saw what looked like a maraschino cherry on my belly, with a black crumb on its top; the black thing brushed off, leaving a spot of blood on the red dome, and I realized that it was my mole. Over the next 3 days the red sphere gradually deflated, and what remained was the soft, flat light brown original mole. Every few years I have had suddenly emerging moles, of various sizes and colors. Each time I would apply some progesterone or DHEA dissolved in vitamin E to the surrounding skin. If I applied it to just one side, there would be an emigration of cells on the other side, like a moving shadow of the mole, and the mole would lose volume and become lighter in color. When I had been in Florida and stopped using thyroid because of the heat and humidity, a 2 centimeter diameter mole (jumbo black olive-like) grew in front of my ear during 2 or 3 weeks. A soon as I returned to Oregon I started using thyroid, and the mole immediately began shrinking and fading. About two weeks later, the pale remnant on a dry stalk fell off, without leaving a scar. Since then I have generally recommended just becoming slightly hyperthyroid, if a person is generally in good health with enough cholesterol for conversion to the hormones), and other people have had similar experiences with very quickly shrinking moles."

There are some nutritional deficiencies that can cause recurring infections. Vitamin D deficiencies are very common, and predispose to all sorts of immunity problems. Hypothyroidism and vitamin A deficiencies sometimes lead to prolonged infections, and increased TSH is very closely involved with high blood pressure."

But I also found that a slightly too strong solution could cause a mole to develop almost instantly, with an invasion of pigment cells. I think a safer alternative would be to supplement, either topically or orally, a little DHEA."

A good T<sub>3</sub> supplement is usually the quickest way to correct breast inflammation and pain. Have you checked your temperature and pulse rate? A sluggish intestine interferes with the excretion of estrogen, so raw carrots or a laxative can often, in just a day or two, increase the ratio of progesterone to estrogen. Extra salt in your food, and a little vitamin B<sub>6</sub> could help to lower the prolactin. Low thyroid increases water retention but causes sodium loss, and that combination increases swelling and inflammation; the diuretic effect of tea or coffee might help with the swelling."

Estrogen increases the presence of mast cells, which are found increased in the painful area. Mast cells secrete a variety of proinflammatory and pain-inducing substances including histamine, serotonin, and renin, which is converted locally to angiotensin. Estrogen supports formation of all those. Low vitamin D, low calcium intake relative to phosphate, and low thyroid function contribute to the excess of estrogen relative to progesterone. Vitamin D, milk, cyproheptadine (antagonist to histamine and serotonin), thyroid, and angiotensin blockers (such as telmisartan or candesartan) should help to correct the condition."

Sugars, if they are consumed in quantities beyond the ability to metabolize them (and that easily happens in the presence of PUFA) are converted into saturated fatty acids, which have antistress, antiinflammatory effects. Many propaganda experiments are set up, feeding a grossly excessive amount of polyunsaturated fat, causing sugar to form fat, specifically so they can publish their silly diet recommendations, which supposedly explain the obesity epidemic, but the government figures I cited show that vegetable fat consumption has increased, sugar hasn't. My articles have a lot of information on the mechanisms, such as the so-called 'Randle cycle,' in which fatty acids shut down the ability to oxidize sugar. Polyunsaturated fats do many things that increase blood sugar inappropriately, and my articles review several of the major mechanisms.Several years ago, medical people started talking about the harmful effects of insulin, such as stimulating fat production, so 'insulin resistance' which keeps a high level of insulin from producing obesity would seem to be a good thing, but the medical obesity culture really isn't thinking very straight. One factor in the 'insulin resistance' created by PUFA involves estrogen&mdash;chronic accumulation of PUFA in the tissues increases the production of estrogen, and the polyunsaturated free fatty acids intensify the actions of estrogen, which acts in several ways to interfere with glucose oxidation."

I think it's common for kids to be diagnosed as diabetic when they have high blood sugar following a sickness such as flu; insulin treatment can institutionalize an over-production of the stress hormones. Inflammation of the intestine (which can start with an infection) can be sustained by undigested starches, and the resulting endotoxin/nitric oxide/serotonin can cause insulin resistance, so it's important to keep the small intestine relatively germ-free. Melons and potatoes can feed bacteria if they are present.

          "answer": "My recommendation is to eat to increase the metabolic rate (usually temperature and heart rate), rather than any particular foods. Usually the increased metabolic rate, with adequate protein, causes some muscle increase, and when that happens the basic calorie requirement will increase. The increase of muscle mass should continue for several weeks, and during that time the weight might increase a little, but usually the loss of water and fat will compensate for the greater muscle mass. I have heard from several people that they think I recommend drinking whole milk, which I don't, because the amount of fat in whole milk is very likely to be fattening when a person is using it to get the needed protein and calcium. When a person wants to lose excess fat, limiting the diet to low fat milk, eggs, orange juice, and a daily carrot or two, will provide the essential nutrients without excess calories."

When a person's metabolic rate increases, and stress hormones decrease, for example when adding two quarts of milk to the daily diet, their muscle mass is likely to increase, even while their fat is decreasing. Since muscle burns fat faster than fat does, caloric requirements will gradually increase."

Two important causes for that difference are the high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, which limits lactic acid production, and the absence of the n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In adulthood, the tissues become progressively more loaded with fats of that type, leading to greater production of inflammatory agents such as prostaglandins, and an increasing tendency to produce lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide. Chronic systemic inflammation is the central factor in the various degenerative diseases."

          "answer": "There are lots of areas of similar amino acid sequences in proteins of microorganisms and animals, that are important for shaping the protein and making it fit into its normal place in the cell. Even slight “denaturation” of a protein can expose those areas, so stress, changing normal relationships, can make things antigenic. Someone found that an animal's own cartilage, normally not antigenic, became antigenic after the cartilage was twisted. Energy depletion of a tissue makes it very susceptible to having its antigenic regions exposed; hypothyroidism, and high estrogen, make tissues swell; our “immune system” helps to correct the damage, removing things that are seriously disrupted. Progesterone and pregnenolone have a stabilizing effect, supported by thyroid and CO<sub>2</sub>. When the damaged tissues are restored, the antibodies will gradually disappear. Well cooked mushrooms and bamboo shoots are probably more effective than carrots. Small amounts of antibiotics, flowers of sulfur, and aspirin, and bacteriophage can help by reducing bacteria in the small intestine."

Ordinary authoritarian relationships, which are the norm, make everyone forget what it felt like to just be a self, before language and assigned identities existed. When relaxing after a very nice meal, pleasant feelings pass through the torso. Getting into the habit of looking for those feelings whenever you have a free moment, you can make them occur more often; they represent part of self-possession. The state of the brain models the state of those perceptions; the crucial neurosteroids that let new patterns develop are pregnenolone, progesterone, vitamin D, and (cautiously) a little DHEA; the energy-supporting high calcium diet supports their metabolism. With practice, this sense of well being and wholeness grows."

          "answer": "Although I think escaping from stressful situations is good in principle, it can be very hard in practice. For acute situations, having a milkshake, some pregnenolone and progesterone and coffee as needed, can make it possible to direct the anger energy into mental actions. The reality is that societies are populated mostly by those authoritarian automatons, but when I realize that the world still contains lots of sentient intelligent beings—some humans, many mammals, insects, mollusks, plants&ndash;I see that alienation from the malicious system is better than joining it.\n\n It's helpful to understand how particular bad actions fit into the bad system, even though it makes you realize that the problem is immensely bigger than the immediate thing that you're reacting to. Wilhelm Reich and Alice Miller wrote about some of the ways that the evil automatons are created. But beyond that system of automatons, there's the real world of living intelligences.\n\n When I was investigating how my autonomic nervous system works, I realized that my body takes on specific feelings in the presence of different individuals, with a sense of fibers going out from the solar plexus connecting with people that I feel free with, and a sense of shrinking discomfort in other situations. With practice, I found that I had some control over those reactions, and by directing my attention to them I could maintain a sense of myself while in the presence of the manipulators-robots.\n\n Besides being self protective or therapeutic, the consciousness of alienation from a bad system puts you into a position where you might be able to reduce some of its destructiveness."

          "answer": "Estrogen is a stress and crisis hormone, so there's a steady upward tendency in its effect with age, which is interrupted during the fertile years by progesterone. Progesterone decline usually starts around age 40 because of things interfering with thyroid function. Declining liver function and increasing pituitary activity influence the way problems develop. Oxygen tension is normally low in bone marrow, and stimulates constant cell proliferation, but when estrogen's oxygen-wasting effect is added, it changes the balance of cell growth; its worst effect is to stimulate fibroblasts and collagen production in the marrow, displacing the red and white cells. Estrogen shifts cells from oxidative production of carbon dioxide to the glycolytic formation of lactic acid, tending to prevent normal differentiation of cell function. The effects of estrogen include the leakage of the lactic acid-forming enzyme LDH into the serum, and the increase of copper in the serum, and these are recognized as signs of CLL, but the genetic-clonal ideology of cancer prevents recognition of the metabolic pattern. Estrogen causes relative hyperventilation, reinforcing the cellular changes. CLL seems to be less common in people adapted to high altitude, where lactic acid formation is inhibited."

          "answer": "Some of the basic ideas about the mechanisms of energy production are mistaken, for example that glycolysis is controlled by random diffusion, and the chemiosmotic theory of mitochondrial phosphorylation, but there's still useful information available regarding the bigger picture, looking at the “energy charge” and the ratios of oxidized and reduced molecules, for example. Cancer involves a shift in the direction of reduction&mdash;an idea that has been around for over 60 years, but kept in the background by the genetic dogma. Oxidative metabolism shifts the balance away from cell multiplication, allowing specific functions, and so allows an organism to recover from cancer. The doctrine that cancers are genetically mutated cells justifies the standard treatments&mdash;surgery, radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy&mdash;intended to kill 100% of the mutant cells. The problem is that the damaged region where the tumor had been is left in a reductive state, and signals the organism for repair cells, and those become abnormal when they enter the region of destruction. Cancer mortality figures have been manipulated to convince the public that the standard treatments produce a certain rate of cure, but cancer deaths have increased parallel to the increased number of people treated. For example, the biggest surge in prostate cancer deaths came in the 1990s after the discovery of the prostate specific antigen, PSA, which greatly increased the number of people receiving treatment. In the 1950s, Dan Mazia and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi were showing how the reductive condition of a cell relates to cancer; Frances Knock was another person working in that direction. In just the last few years, there are signs that this approach is coming to the foreground of biological research. But it can't be officially acknowledged, because it would reveal the carcinogenic and irrational nature of the standard treatments."

Orange juice contains naringenin which is effective against melanoma, and guavas contain apigenin, also effective. A diet consisting of milk, orange juice, guavas, cheese, and some eggs, liver, and oysters, with aspirin would be protective against the spread of the tumor. Thorne's high potency vitamin K drops would help with the blood pressure, and vitamin K also has some anticancer activity, and is necessary when you use a lot of aspirin.

Known causes involve inflammatory, excitatory processes, and when those are eliminated, tumors tend to disintegrate, undergoing “apoptosis,” a form of cell death that doesn't create new inflammation.

Progesterone is already being used medically, “experimentally,” for brain protection and repair, pregnenolone has some of the similar effects, probably not as powerfully, but it's safe in any quantity. Carbon dioxide increase can often restore circulation to areas that have a vascular spasm; a little baking soda in water sometimes helps that. Sugar sometimes helps with constipation. They should be doing something for the constipation; inflammation is often involved, and aspirin and cascara (emodin) are helpful if the main blockage can be overcome with enemas. Inflamed tissues are hyperosmotic, so enemas with the standard 0.9% saline cause tissue swelling; double or triple osmolar saline is usually helpful."

Vitamin K (1 or 2) is probably better to use before aspirin, since it helps to prevent both more clotting and also bleeding. A day after the vitamin K the aspirin would be safer, and it helps to protect brain cells. Niacinamide, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> and biotin are other brain protective things, even is small amounts. Hospitals often treat strokes with too much oxygen, to reduce brain pressure, but that reduces circulation to the brain; 5% carbon dioxide with oxygen helps to reduce brain swelling while maintaining circulation."

We are constantly exposed to foreign DNA and RNA, and it rarely has a harmful effect, but with fatigue and inflammation, normally harmless things become dangerous. Since the new vaccines are intended to make us produce a protein that blocks ACE2, which is possibly our most important protective antiinflammatory defense, along with a lipid adjuvant to increase inflammation, they seem riskier than the previous kinds that evoked antibodies against a foreign antigen."

Progesterone is usually helpful in moderate, physiological amounts, maybe 20 to 30 mg per day (with food), but more would be o.k. if the effects seem better. The frontal lobes of the brain are involved in focussing attention and planning, and these hormones stabilize the major frontal lobe nerves. Vitamin D and calcium are essential for the protective effects of these hormones, so it would be good to have a vitamin D blood test.

A friend's dog appeared to have lost an eye after a fight—just a red socket was visible; he put it on a fresh goat milk diet, and what looked like a small eye appeared in the socket after a couple weeks, and after several weeks it had a normal eye, with vision."

The antiseptic fibrous foods (raw carrot, cooked mushrooms or bamboo shoots) eaten regularly, and avoiding the very rottable indigestible foods such as green salads, give chronic protection against bacteria. Avoiding excess phosphate lowers stress and inflammation, and getting plenty of calcium and vitamin D helps to balance the phosphate. Some aspirin at bedtime might be helpful."

The tetracyclines are more often used for acne, because they have a general antiinflammatory effect, besides the germicidal action. The conventional doses are usually unnecessarily large, based on an assumption that the person has no functional immune system. Large doses of antibiotics have a slight toxic effect on human cells, so I think it's best to use them according to results, rather than formula."

Two milligrams can make a big difference, and when symptoms stop the effects can last for days without using it."

I was interested in its effects on cell water, stabilizing it in a way that reduces some kinds of inflammation. It seems to accelerate some enzyme reactions. I later started to think about its own chemical properties, rather than thinking of it as just a solvent. It isn't stable in the presence of water, and the odor seems to indicate the degree of its decomposition. It occasionally helps slightly with joint pain, but it can cause intense skin reactions, rashes; I think some of its effects depend on the breakdown products. People often forget that it has an intrinsic oxidative effect when they are thinking of it as just a solvent, to transport drugs. I saw a product sold as eye drops, consisting of vitamin C and glutathione in DMSO. Each of those reductants, in the presence of DMSO, immediately breaks down into other substances, and the composition changes continually over a long period. There has been very little investigation of the actual composition of solutions of DMSO with other substances. At least some of the mixtures will produce sulfite and metabisulfite, which are very allergenic for some people."

A slight disturbance of cell water activates nitric oxide synthesis, and that interacts both directly and indirectly with many things, including reduced energy production and destabilization of DNA. Martin Pall and others have shown that millimeter waves, too, can interact with cell water and increase nitric oxide, suggesting that some of their effects will be the same as those of ionizing radiation. An article by Betskii and Lebedeva says millimeter waves are being used therapeutically in Russia, so the harmful effects that Pall and others describe apparently aren't immediately apparent."

Topically, it's probably not as toxic as mercurochrome; permanganate and copper sulfate might be just a little safer. How does silver kill bacteria? It works pretty much by the same mechanism that makes mercury a powerful antiseptic. Heavy metals are relatively indiscriminate oxidants (potent oxidizing agents). All heavy metals&mdash;lead, silver, mercury, nickel, cadmium&mdash;are very toxic, potent enzyme poisons and go into the brain, causing diseases like Alzheimer's, ALS, MS, etc."

If he hasn't been exposed for a few months, then the short hair would give a clue to the amount that's stored. Animal studies showed that chelation can increase metal toxicity to the brain and kidneys. Vitamin C and other acids in orange juice reduce the toxicity of mercury and allow it to be excreted safely. At least for some metals, coffee seems to have a similar effect."

Although they darken a little when they age, they don't rust.\n\n There are two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The nonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic and carcinogenic. It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can use a little “refrigerator magnet” to test your pans. The magnet will stick firmly to the safer type of pan.\n\n I think the nickel content should be less than 2%; the magnetic pans are hard to find (used stores sometimes have old ones), because people generally prefer the slick high nickel type."

The idea that distilled water is harmful probably derives from the fact that in areas where the water has a high mineral content, people have been healthier on average than in areas with naturally “soft” water, but that involves several factors, especially the fact that hard water doesn't dissolve as much lead from the plumbing (such as soldered connections of copper pipes), and also that agricultural products in those areas are likely to have a higher trace mineral content. Generally, water is softer in areas with higher rainfall, and that means that people in those regions are more likely to have less sunlight, and a vitamin D deficiency affects mineral metabolism. In general, it's best to drink water only when you're thirsty."

The inner-spring mattress people showed how much better it was if the bed didn't sag in the middle, and for about a generation Simmons and other companies made very soft innerspring mattresses that allowed the hips and shoulder to sink, letting the back stay straight.\n \n The idea of mattress firmness blended with ideas of duty, toughness, exercise, and health, until the most expensive mattresses felt like a futon on concrete."

          "answer": "Knowledge isn't a commodity, especially not a fungible commodity, as the medical business sees it. Consciousness and culture are part of the life process. It is exactly the commoditization of medical knowledge that makes it dangerous, and generally stupid. Doctors buy their knowledge, and then resell it over and over; it's valuable as a commodity, so its value has to be protected by the equivalent of a copyright, the system of laws establishing the profession. Without its special status, its worthlessness would be quickly demonstrated. When A.C. Guyton wrote his textbook of medical physiology (the most widely used text in the world) in the 1950s, it was trash; as it was studied and applied by generations of physicians, it was still trash. The most compliant patients who bought their treatment from the most authoritative, Guytonesque, doctors were buying their own disability and death. \n \n Each time you learn something, your consciousness becomes something different, and the questions you ask will be different; you don't know what the next appropriate question will be when you haven't assimilated the earlier answers. Until you see something as the answer to an urgent question, you can't see that it has any value. The unexpected can't be a commodity. When people buy professional knowledge they get what they pay for, a commodity in a system that sustains ignorance."

Nothing was displaced noticeably, so there was nothing to do but let it heal. I had known people with broken bones that had been badly set by doctors, and others whose bones had been perfectly set by farmers, so I would have had a friend help if I couldn't reset a major fracture by myself. If a person doesn't understand what's happening to them, and thinks it's something that a hospital could help, they should go, but they should also have a reasonable amount of knowledge about their body, and about the dangers of hospitalization. A couple of years ago I was involved, by telephone, with someone who suddenly developed extreme weakness and bleeding in his lungs, and whose doctor quickly did a series of appropriate tests and used appropriate treatments, and brought him back from a comatose state in a few days. It was the sort of thing that Dr. House might have done, the intelligent application of a large amount of knowledge. Such things are possible, but after having seen hundreds of people ruined by medical ignorance, I was surprised to see that it could actually happen."

I felt that the current US view of the brain as a computing device with nerves serving as wires and switches was completely inappropriate, even for understanding things such as the perception of odors and musical pitch, and around that time a practical study of creativity was published, in a book called Synectics, and I saw that Pavlov's colleague P.K. Anokhin had been developing a much better understanding of brain function. The fact that sensations and perception of space in dreams can be so convincing led me to feel that biological/metabolic processes in the brain reproduce in fairly direct or literal ways things in the external world, i.e., that our experience of internal colors and smells and sounds are probably a sort of electrochemical resonance within nerves&mdash;with a nerve and its surroundings, spatial parts of the brain, taking on energetic states with the frequencies that are closely analogous to the frequencies produced by the external objects, colors, chemical odors, sound vibrations, as well as other kinds of patterned relationships. If “photons” or electromagnetic interactions within the organism are the substance of consciousness, then the electronic properties of nutrients, hormones, and drugs are important, rather than their geometric form, as interpreted by the “lock-and-key” “receptor and ligand” doctrine. I think the active chemical in St. John's wort is hypericin, an anthroquine (very similar to emodin, in cascara, and to vitamin K and tetracycline), which is a large system of conjugated electrons, that interacts powerfully with our cellular regulatory systems. (&hellip;{}) I suspect that growing up with creativity involves opportunities that cause the brain to develop various sensitivities and resonances, and that the brain functioning in these ways calls up the energetic and hormonal resources that it needs, and ideally that includes an array of chemicals that enrich and intensify consciousness, allowing very complex internal experiences to be generated."

R.O Becker discussed weak natural electromagnetic rhythms, Frank Brown did many experiments showing the effects of surrounding fields on biorhythms, Solco Tromp's publications on biometeorology and Michel Gauquelin's statistical studies showed other effects. There have been quite a few Hindu publications on body cycles. When I taught school and had to get up at the same time every day, I developed a strong metabolic rhythm that made me go to sleep immediately at 10:30, and if I had to stay awake, I had a sudden loss of energy exactly at 10:30. A daytime nap that's timed according to the small cycles can be very effective."

          "answer": "Just for an example, if you touch a marble with the tips of crossed fingers, the first reaction is that there are two marbles, because of the normal projection of awareness of objects in the world. When you look at an empty sky, you can usually notice different kinds of “objects” or textures, that aren't the sky (some people insist that those are something in the sky; others that they are nothing but debris in the eye); when you direct your attention to the sensory surface, rather than to the object, you can notice that the process of noticing affects what you notice. Attention to this process makes it possible to feel the process of thought interacting with sensations. Inattention to those processes leaves a person trapped in the system of verbal concepts and rules."

          "question": "Follow-up: what does “projection of awareness of objects in the world” mean?",
          "answer": "Every tissue contains nerves, and for some of these, the proprioceptive nerves, their object is what we feel as our body. Other nerves sense things that we understand as objects in some sense&mdash;sound is felt to come from somewhere in the space around us, smells usually the same, and tastes represent the objects that we are eating. But in each case, it's possible to experience our sensing without imagining objects as the cause of the sensation. The value of that is that it gives you an absolute, uninterpreted, experience, which makes it possible to put the verbal life history that we normally inhabit, into a new context. In the case of seeing with your eyes closed (with light on the closed eyelids, the situation is similar to looking at an empty sky), a finely granular texture is the retina itself, and/or the optic nerve. A textureless, dreamlike substance of space filling images, a relatively free activity of the visual cortex and more complex brain systems, will gradually be noticed, when there's the right combination of nervous arousal and relaxation. The behavior of after-images will change according to the state of the whole organism, for example the length of time that it stays positive, and the length of time that a following negative image lasts. It's the same with after-images of motion; their differences between people are very interesting."

While I think consciousness is electronic, I don't think it's appropriate to think of it as being just inside cells (much less simply a matter of synaptic interactions). Electricity's space-filling property is relevant. The process (or background, that we call body or self) that gives continuity and meaning to our perceptions and actions is something that's always happening, and people usually turn their attention away from it when they aren't in some practical or objective activity. The organism has many potential intentions, and if we let our attention respond, they can appear as hypnagogic images or dreams. Ordinary metabolism, and its variations, are always producing these parallel spaces, and their quality varies under the influence of various metabolites and “dopants.” I think the electric universe is analogous to the electric organism."

Studies of nerves show that after heat is emitted during activity, heat is absorbed during recovery, i.e. The nerve slightly refrigerates its surroundings. The absorption of heat (besides preventing over-heating) as ATP is resynthesized would make the usual expectations about chemical energy and work less applicable."

Morgan officials and Henry Luce's publications. Their plan was to say that they were taking over because of the president's poor health. Because Butler went to congress to reveal the plot, it was delayed for 11 years. The Dulles brothers managed the US government from 1945 to 1963, and Gladio guided Europe. In 1965 at Blake College, we had a course on the role of the Masons in the politics of Latin America, taught by Iso Brante, who had done considerable research on the subject. At that time, the Sinarquistas were still very active in Mexico. For a long time I have thought of Russia and the west side of Latin America as the places where civilization would have its best chance to escape."

In his model of the “receptor” that responds to a drug he didn't talk about the things surrounding the receptor, which transmit the effect into the cell; the standard idea is that “molecular cascades” of interaction diffuse the signal through the cytoplasm, but an alternative view is that the microtrabecular system is a communication system. It would be within this molecular network that the electronic resonance coherently transmits the excitations that make up consciousness. Resonant theories of sense and awareness go back at least 70 years. In the 1960s to 1980s, when all the textbooks described the cytoplasm as a liquid in which reactions were governed by free diffusion, with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, Sidney Bernard showed, stoichiometrically, that there is no free diffusion involved in the reactions of glycolysis, and glycolysis was the very basis for the belief that biochemistry could be studied in test-tubes, in watery solution. This requires a different view of cell organization. The living cell can be seen as an excitable medium, supporting oscillating reactions, with an inherent directionality. A.G.Gurwich, P.K. Anokhin, A. Szent-Gyorgyi, Mae-Wan Ho, and many others have contributed to developing this view"

When I was a kid I read about someone who spent many weeks on the ocean without fresh water, and he said he started taking sips of sea water before their supplies of water ran out, and while the others on the boat were dying of dehydration, he was able to subsist on the seawater. Another later book described survival in a similar situation, after a nurse administered seawater enemas, knowing that the colon is able to extract water from a “hyperosmotic” solution. When a person is swimming for many hours, even in seawater, some water is absorbed through the skin. The way to understand it is to think of cell water as a solute, rather than a solvent—sodium is less soluble in cells than water is. Carbon dioxide, cholesterol, magnesium, progesterone, and urea are things that, by regulating the structure of the cytoplasm, affect its solubility properties."

In the 1980s my girl friend complained about the turpentine smell, so when I couldn't paint outside (Oregon winter) I started using mostly latex house paints, and sometimes oil pastels. The disadvantage of a latex or acrylic paint is that it dries so fast that it doesn't let you think while mixing colors on a palette. Since I didn't have skin contact with the pigments I wasn't worried about their toxicity, but I used some paint sticks 20 years ago, and noticed that an umber color was extremely allergenic or toxic to touch. A few years ago I decided to go back to oil with turpentine, and learned that the pine turpentine industry has disappeared—the familiar green and white cans of “pure gum spirits of turpentine” now contained a gasoline-like petroleum distillate. If pure turpentine was available, that, with oils, would be my preferred medium."

Right after the Madalyn events, I learned that they were funding an experimental, student centered college at Fordham University, and I think other places; the foundation and the government worked closely together, and I think they saw the importance of co-opting the movement, to keep it from getting too independent, i.e., anti-imperialist. I think our idea of giving a diploma whenever the person scored very high on the Graduate Record Exam, which would let them get into good graduate study programs, was the main point they wanted to suppress, since it eliminated all of the judgmental points of control in the process."

Any syllabus should function as just a direction in which to exercise critical thinking; everything worth knowing becomes more when it's taken up and used."

          "answer": "I don't know much about his work, but about 60 years ago I read about people who had detailed knowledge of preceding lives. Since I am always starting from the radical empirical awareness of complexity constantly changing in meaningful ways, I am also always considering ways to understand the meanings of the regularities. I think a quality of coherence in things, covering situations that used to be explained by a luminiferous ether, can be thought of as a “formative ether,” with resonant processes that span spaces and times. We can resonate in the same time with organisms in different places, affecting our complex developmental processes. Substances are always participating in particular situations or fields, and are never merely random. The “orthogenetic” theory of evolution described a developmental inertia, in which the existence of a structure leads to more of the same structure. A structure in one organism affects its interactions, so that a functional (or eco-) system tends to develop its own inertia. Within a certain society, these functional systems could span generations, eliciting “phenocopies” transgenerationally. Lancelot Whyte's “formative principle” and Rupert Sheldrake's “formative causation” just need a more concrete physical substrate, that I think exists in fragments, from Leibniz to Bose to Polanyi, to Horace Dudley and J.L. Anderson, etc. The idea of resonance needs a better understanding of substance as/incorporating its fields—and nothing has private independent fields."

Their timeless and colorless world is worse than a simply flat world. Our culture is swamped with highly authoritative disinformation; maybe the flat-earthers can be persuaded to be skeptical about other elements of the predominant world view. In Generative Energy I wrote about the expanding earth theory, and I've commented favorably on Halton Arp's work on galaxies, and Kozyrev's theory of stellar energy, Hannes Alfvén's plasma cosmology—nothing that's easy to interpret as flatness."

It was just after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island when people were turning against nuclear power, that the public's attention was diverted from cooling of the planet and a predicted new ice age, that had been discussed for decades, to the new warming supposedly caused by use of fossil fuels."
